# PID-Controller
This project will allow a microcontroller to provide a desired output based on reading from an IMU, using a Proportional Integral Derivative Controller (PID Controller).

# Technologies
##IDE: This project was written with ProjectIO for VSCode in mind. Although you can still copy the main.cpp code and paste it into the Arduino IDE with no issues.

##Microcontroller: The microcontroller I built this around was for the Teensy 4.1, of course you can use any microcontroller that supports I2C. 

##IMU: The IMU used in this project is the MPU6050. I felt that it was most accessible part to use for this project for having good examples and an excellent library that was easy to read.

# Installation
##VSCode: 
1 .Ensure that the PlatformIO extension is installed on VSCode, and that you have the most up to date version.
2. Copy the URL to the github repo [PID-Controller](
3. In PlatformIO
